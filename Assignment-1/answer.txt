ANSWER =>
 Conditional statements in programming are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. These statements allow the execution of different code blocks depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false, providing a fundamental mechanism for decision-making in algorithms. In this article, we will learn about the basics of Conditional Statements along with their different types.

syntax:-

 if (condition) {
    // code block to execute if condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
    // code block to execute if anotherCondition is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if none of the above conditions are true
}
